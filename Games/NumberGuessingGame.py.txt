#Guessing Higher Lower Game:::
#The computer will think of a number between 1 and 100.
#The player will try to guess the number.
#After each guess, the computer will tell the player if their guess was higher or lower
#than the number it is thinking of.
#The game will continue until the player guesses the number correctly.
#The computer will keep track of the number of guesses the player makes.
#The game will end when the player guesses the number correctly, and the computer will tell the
#player the number of guesses it took to win.
